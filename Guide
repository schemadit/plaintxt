        PC SECURITY DEFENSE GUIDE — 2026 EDITION
        99.9% Attack Prevention — Full Plaintext Version
================================================================

MODERN THREAT LANDSCAPE
------------------------
- Bootkits / UEFI Malware     → Survives OS reinstall, lives in firmware
- Session Cookie Theft        → Bypasses passwords and 2FA entirely
- Infostealers in Cracked SW  → 99% of cracks in 2026 carry payloads
- Kernel-Level Injectors      → Target unprotected Windows kernels
- Zero-Click Spyware (Pegasus)→ Infects with ZERO user interaction
- Commercial Stalkerware      → Remote monitoring via phone/PC access


================================================================
PHASE 1: FIRMWARE FORTRESS + ZERO-CLICK SPYWARE DEFENSE
================================================================

This is the deepest attack surface. A bootkit here survives a full
Windows reinstall. Zero-click spyware like Pegasus, Predator, and
Reign target devices at the OS and network level — with no clicks,
no downloads, no mistakes on your part required.


--- 1A. Close the BlackLotus Bypass (The 0x80 Fix) ---

Microsoft's Secure Boot patch is INACTIVE by default. You must
manually force revocation of old, vulnerable bootloaders.

Open PowerShell (Admin) and run ALL THREE commands:

  reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Secureboot /v AvailableUpdates /t REG_DWORD /d 0x40 /f

  reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Secureboot /v AvailableUpdates /t REG_DWORD /d 0x100 /f

  reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Secureboot /v AvailableUpdates /t REG_DWORD /d 0x80 /f

Restart your PC TWICE after running all three.

Result: Windows now rejects the cryptographic keys used by
BlackLotus, CosmicStrand, and related UEFI bootkits.


--- 1B. Lock the BIOS/UEFI ---

Even perfect OS security fails if malware can reach into BIOS and
disable Secure Boot. A Supervisor Password blocks this.

  - Enter BIOS/UEFI at startup (usually F2, DEL, or F10)
  - Security → Set a Supervisor/Administrator Password
  - Confirm Secure Boot is ON (Standard or Custom mode)
  - Confirm TPM 2.0 is ON and Active
  - Disable boot from USB/network unless you specifically need it

WARNING: Without a BIOS password, deep malware can disable Secure
Boot and install itself before Windows even loads.


--- 1C. Zero-Click and No-Contact Spyware Defense ---

WHAT IS ZERO-CLICK SPYWARE?
Pegasus (NSO Group), Predator (Intellexa), and Reign (QuaDream)
are commercial surveillance tools sold to governments. They can
infect a device with absolutely no action from you — no link click,
no download, nothing. Attack vectors include:

  - Missed or answered phone calls (WhatsApp, regular calls)
  - Message previews that load silently in the background
  - Push notifications
  - AirPlay/network-level injection (CVE-2025-24252 "AirBorne")
  - Email preview pane rendering (CVE-2025-21298, Outlook OLE)
  - Compromised messaging apps exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities

Once installed, it can read all messages, activate your microphone
and camera, steal passwords, track location, and exfiltrate
everything — while remaining virtually undetectable by antivirus.

WHO IS AT RISK?
Pegasus specifically targets journalists, activists, executives,
politicians, and dissidents. If you are not in these categories,
nation-state-grade Pegasus is unlikely to be aimed at you.
However, Pegasus-style commercial stalkerware and cheaper
imitations are increasingly used in domestic abuse, corporate
espionage, and general crime.

DEFENSE STEPS FOR ZERO-CLICK / NO-CONTACT SPYWARE:

  STEP 1 — Enable Lockdown Mode (iPhone) / Advanced Protection (Android)
    - iPhone: Settings → Privacy & Security → Lockdown Mode → Turn On
      This disables many attack surfaces (link previews, FaceTime from
      strangers, wired accessories, complex web features).
    - Android Pixel: Settings → Security → Advanced Protection Program

  STEP 2 — Reboot your phone daily
    Pegasus is often memory-resident. A reboot can clear infections
    that haven't established full persistence. This was confirmed by
    Kaspersky's analysis of the Shutdown.log forensic artifact —
    Pegasus infections leave traces when a reboot interrupts them.

  STEP 3 — Disable iMessage and FaceTime if not needed (iPhone)
    Historically one of the most exploited zero-click surfaces.
    Settings → Messages → toggle iMessage OFF if not required.
    Settings → FaceTime → toggle OFF.

  STEP 4 — Keep ALL apps and OS fully updated immediately
    Zero-click attacks exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. The window
    between a patch release and your install is your attack window.
    Enable automatic updates for iOS, Android, and all apps.

  STEP 5 — Use Signal for sensitive communications
    Signal has a significantly stronger security record than
    WhatsApp, Telegram (in default mode), or SMS. Enable
    "Note to Self" disappearing messages and sealed sender.

  STEP 6 — Audit app permissions aggressively
    Revoke microphone, camera, and location from every app that
    does not strictly require it. Check monthly.

  STEP 7 — Never connect to untrusted Wi-Fi networks
    Network injection attacks (used by Pegasus operators) can
    deliver payloads through your network traffic. Use a VPN
    on all untrusted networks (hotel, cafe, airport).

  STEP 8 — Use iVerify or MVT to scan for infection
    - iVerify (iOS/Android): Commercial tool by Trail of Bits,
      designed for high-risk individuals. Detects behavioral
      anomalies consistent with spyware. Available on App Store.
    - MVT (Mobile Verification Toolkit): Free, open-source tool
      by Amnesty International. Forensic-grade analysis.
      GitHub: https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt
      Requires command-line knowledge. Run after any suspicious event.

  STEP 9 — Physical access = full compromise
    Commercial stalkerware (FlexiSpy, mSpy, etc.) requires
    brief physical access to your device to install.
    - Use a strong biometric + PIN lock. Never leave phone
      unattended with someone you don't fully trust.
    - Check Settings → Apps for anything you don't recognize.
    - On iPhone: Settings → Privacy → check each permission list
      for apps you didn't install yourself.

  STEP 10 — Consider a dedicated "sensitive comms" device
    If you are a journalist, activist, or handle sensitive work:
    use a separate, factory-reset device solely for high-risk
    communications. Never install third-party apps on it.

HONEST ASSESSMENT:
Nation-state Pegasus is extremely difficult to fully defeat once
deployed — it is designed by a well-funded company specifically to
evade all defenses. These steps significantly raise the cost and
difficulty of infection and are the current best-practice consensus
from Amnesty International, Kaspersky GReAT, and Citizen Lab.

================================================================
PHASE 2: OS HARDENING (THE BODYGUARD)
================================================================

Make Windows a hostile environment for malware.


--- 1. Enable Core Isolation — Memory Integrity (HVCI) ---

  - Search "Core Isolation" in Windows Start
  - Toggle Memory Integrity to ON
  - Restart when prompted

WHY: HVCI uses hardware virtualisation to create a protected
bubble around the Windows Kernel. Malware cannot inject
unsigned code into your system's brain even with Admin rights.


--- 2. Use a Standard User Account for Daily Work ---

Running as Administrator for everything is extremely dangerous.
An infected browser running as Admin can silently install
kernel-level drivers.

  - Settings → Accounts → Family & other users
  - Add a new account → set as Standard User
  - Use this for ALL daily work, browsing, and social media
  - Keep your Admin account only for software installation


--- 3. Enable BitLocker Drive Encryption ---

  - Search "Manage BitLocker" in Start → Turn On for C: drive
  - Save recovery key to a safe OFFLINE location (not same PC)

If your PC is stolen or someone boots from USB, they see nothing
but encrypted data.


--- 4. Keep Windows Update on Automatic ---

  Settings → Windows Update → Advanced Options
  Enable: "Receive updates for other Microsoft products"

Most successful real-world attacks exploit unpatched systems.
There is no excuse for being months behind on patches.


================================================================
PHASE 3: THE VAULT — BROWSER ISOLATION (KASM + VIRTUALBOX)
================================================================

RULE: Never browse your sensitive accounts (Facebook, YouTube,
banking) directly on your Windows host machine.


--- 1. Create the Lab (VirtualBox) ---

  - Download VirtualBox from virtualbox.org and install it
  - Create a new Linux VM: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS recommended
  - Enable EFI in the VM settings before first boot
  - Allocate: 4+ GB RAM, 20+ GB storage
  - After first setup is complete, take a Snapshot → name it "CLEAN"

If you ever click a bad link or suspect infection:
Restore → CLEAN → the entire browser and any virus is deleted
from history instantly.


--- 2. Install Kasm Workspaces Inside the VM ---

Kasm gives you a fully disposable, streaming browser inside a
Docker container. Close the tab = everything destroyed.

Run these commands inside your Ubuntu Server VM terminal:

  curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/kasm_release_1.18.1.tar.gz
  tar -xf kasm_release_1.18.1.tar.gz
  sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh --swap-size 4096


--- 3. The Workflow ---

  1. Open browser on your Windows host
  2. Go to https://localhost:3000 (your Kasm dashboard)
  3. Launch a "Disposable Chrome" workspace
  4. Do ALL your Facebook/YouTube/sensitive browsing inside Kasm
  5. Close the tab → entire session + any virus is permanently destroyed

Your Windows host never touches the dangerous content directly.


================================================================
PHASE 4: THE SENTINEL — SYSMON MONITORING
================================================================

Sysmon is Windows' built-in Security Camera. It logs every
process, network connection, and registry change.


--- 1. Activate Native Sysmon ---

  - Settings → System → Optional Features → More Windows Features
  - Check the box for Sysmon, click OK

  OR via PowerShell (Admin):
    Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:Sysmon

  Then open CMD (Admin) and initialise with a config:
    sysmon -i sysmonconfig.xml

  Download the SwiftOnSecurity config (highly recommended):
    https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config


--- 2. Key Event IDs to Watch ---

Open Event Viewer → Applications and Services Logs
→ Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon

  Event ID 1  → Process Creation
                Detects unknown executables spawning silently
  Event ID 3  → Network Connection
                Detects malware phoning home to C2 servers
  Event ID 11 → File Created
                Detects dropper activity writing payloads to disk
  Event ID 13 → Registry Value Set
                Detects tampering with Secure Boot or autorun keys

SPECIFIC ALERT: Watch Event ID 13 for entries containing
"Confignull" or "Regeditnull" — signs something is tampering
with your boot configuration.


--- 3. Optional: Forward to a Free SIEM ---

For dashboards and automated alerting, run Wazuh or Elastic SIEM
inside your VirtualBox VM and forward Sysmon logs to it.
This gives you correlation rules without cloud dependency.


================================================================
PHASE 5: ACCOUNT ARMOR — THE NO-BS TRUTH
================================================================

Modern viruses don't steal passwords.
They steal SESSION COOKIES.
Even a perfect password + SMS 2FA is useless if your session
cookie is stolen. Address this directly.


--- 1. Get a YubiKey — THIS IS MANDATORY ---

Even if a virus steals your password AND your session cookie AND
your SMS 2FA code, it still cannot log in without the physical
YubiKey in your hand. The key uses FIDO2/WebAuthn cryptographic
challenges that cannot be phished, replayed, or stolen remotely.

  - Register your YubiKey on Facebook, Google, and YouTube
  - YubiKey 5 Series: supports FIDO2, U2F, OTP, PIV
  - Buy a backup key and store it in a safe place


--- 2. Clear Cookies Daily (Cookie Auto-Delete) ---

Install the "Cookie Auto-Delete" browser extension.
Configure it to purge all cookies when a tab closes.

When you close your Kasm browser session, all authenticated
sessions are killed. Nothing left to steal.


--- 3. Zero Cracked Software — Non-Negotiable ---

In 2026, security researchers estimate 99% of cracked software
packages contain Infostealers or Bootkits. A single cracked
game can deploy a UEFI bootkit that survives a full format.

If you regularly use cracked software, all other phases
in this guide are effectively compromised. Period.


--- 4. Additional Account Hardening ---

  - Use unique 20+ character passwords for every account
    (Bitwarden is free and excellent)
  - Enable FIDO2 passkeys wherever supported (replaces passwords)
  - Audit active sessions on Facebook/Google monthly
  - Use a dedicated email for high-value accounts you never share
  - Enable login notifications on all important accounts
